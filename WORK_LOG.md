It DOES get that correct though... If I can somehow optimize this then it could work but idk if it is beyond saving. It is pretty horrible and might literally just be a recursive linear search. I'll try to find ways to make it faster. UPDATE: So apparently my algorithm is going to have exponential space complexity so I think this is completely worthless. For the large test cases it would have a 2^2500 space complexity which is not going to work so I need to think of something else lol. |
| Feb 27th |   1:20 - 2:15   | I deleted all my code and started over. I'm going to try to use a tabulation method for this using a 2d array of integers. These ints will represent the longest possible combo that matches up to that point. I don't fully understand how I need to do the algorithm though so I'm kind of just trying things atm. UPDATE: So I just watched some videos explaining tabulation as a concept to try to help understand it more but they made it look super easy. Like for the fibbonacci sequence I understand how you would do it, but for anything more complex like what we are doing here it seems completely different ? Idk this stuff really confuses me im not gonna lie. |
